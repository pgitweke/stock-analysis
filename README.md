# Greenstocks Analysis

## Overview of Project 

This project analyzes the total daily volume and annual return for 2017 and 2018 for green energy stocks as requested by Steve. 

### Purpose -2 

The goal of this project is to use visual basics application (VBA) to refactor the current green energy stocks code. The data is looped through one time to collect the same information at a short period of time using the VBA timer. The outcome will help Steve diversify his parentâ€™s funds to invest in alternative energy. 

## Analysis of Green Energy Stocks

### All Stocks 2017 and 2018

The snippets above summarize the stocks for each company that uses alternative energy. The first column has the names while the second and third have the total daily volume and return respectively. 
2017 was a great year for green stock percentage return, unlike in 2018 when only two stocks had positive figures. In addition, the total daily volume was consistent in both years, most stocks had a high volume which either increased or decreased in 2018.

Below are screenshots of the amount of time it took for the VBA script to run using the initial code.
